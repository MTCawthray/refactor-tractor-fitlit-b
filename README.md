# Static Comp

This is a project where we were required to refactor, navigate, and build on top of somebody elseâ€™s pre-existing codebase. Since working on another's code is common in software development, it was our first big opportunity to get comfortable doing this.

## Motivation and rubric

This project was completed as a project at Turing School of Software & Design during Module 2.
